  "summary": "The diff partially addresses the request by adding a frontend override to use non-\"/assets/generated\" image paths for the product \"Casuilt Original Leather Watches For Men\", but the backend still serves generated image paths for that product. The diff also changes image handling for another product (\"Classy Watch For Men\"), which conflicts with the stated non-goal to not change images for any other product.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Use the original uploaded images for the product “Casuilt Original Leather Watches For Men” (i.e., ensure the product’s images resolve to the original uploaded photos, not generated assets).",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo still defines the product’s images under \"/assets/generated/...\", so any clients relying on backend-provided image URLs will still receive generated paths rather than the original uploads.",
